# Glue

Glue all the webapps together!

Acts a landing page/connects all of my projects.

Install Steps (for myself):

Run [bootstrap](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/bootstrap)

Setup git credentials, run ssh-agent on interactive shell login:

```sh
eval `ssh-agent` > /dev/null
ssh-add -q ~/.ssh/github
```

Run the `vps_install` script from my [vps](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/vps)
repo to setup everything.
