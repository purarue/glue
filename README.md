# [Glue](https://sean.fish)

Acts a landing page/connects all of my projects.

Handles caching information for albums/tv shows/movies, and [cubing](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/wca_userinfo), and serves it as part of the frontend (react).

The `./development_server` and `./production_server` scripts connect to the companion servers (for serving anime, albums, and cubing information). This server and my production servers are run with `supervisor` by some code [here](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/vps).
